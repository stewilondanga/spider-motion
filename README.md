## Usage

The spider animation is ready to use once you've added the HTML and CSS to your project. You can customize its appearance and behavior by modifying the CSS variables in the 
`spider.css` file.

For example, you can change the size of the spider or adjust the animation speed:

```css
:root {
  --spider-size: 100px; /* Change to your desired size */
  --animation-duration: 5s; /* Change animation speed */
}
```

Explore the CSS file for more customization options.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the spider animation by adjusting CSS variables in the `spider.css` file. Here are some key variables you can modify:

- `--spider-size`: Adjust the spider's size.
- `--animation-duration`: Change the animation speed.
